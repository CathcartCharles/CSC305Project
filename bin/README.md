# CSC305Project
Repository for files in regard to our software development class final project, which is a simulation of a smart car being "hacked" and attempting to divert the user/driver off course
Project features two cars on a scrolling highway background, where one car is controlled by the user and the other is the aforementioned "hacked" car that will try to attack the user and run them off course
User controls the red car with the arrow keys for directional input, and uses shift for an increase in speed. The Green car will doggedly pursue the user car, until the two cars make contact, at which point the user car will be driven off the road and relocated to the center to allow the user to try again.
